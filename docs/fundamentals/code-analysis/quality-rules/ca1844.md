# CA1844: Provide memory-based overrides of async methods when subclassing 'Stream'

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1844|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type derived from <xref:System.IO.Stream> overrides <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync(System.Byte[], System.Int32, System.Int32, System.Threading.CancellationToken)> or <xref:System.IO.Stream.WriteAsync(System.Byte[], System.Int32, System.Int32, System.Threading.CancellationToken)> but does not override <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync(System.Memory<System.Byte>, System.Threading.CancellationToken)> or <xref:System.IO.Stream.WriteAsync(System.ReadOnlyMemory<System.Byte>, System.Threading.CancellationToken)>, respectively.

## Rule description

The memory-based methods were added to improve performance, which they accomplish in multiple ways:

1. They return `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<int>` instead of `Task` and `Task<int>`, respectively, and
2. They allow any type of buffer to be passed in without having to perform an extra copy to an array.

In order to realize these performance benefits, types that subclass <xref:System.IO.Stream> must provide their own memory-based implementation. Otherwise, the default implementation will be forced to copy the memory into an array in order to call the array-based implementation, resulting in reduced performance, particularly when the caller passes in a <xref:System.Memory%601> or <xref:System.ReadOnlyMemory%601> instance that is not backed by an array.

## How to fix violations

The easiest way to fix violations is to rewrite your array-based implementation as a memory-based implementation, and then implement the array-based method(s) in terms of the memory-based method(s).

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress warnings from this rule if you do not care about the performance hit, or if you know that your `Stream` subclass will only ever use the array-based methods, or if your `Stream` subclass has dependencies that do not support memory-based buffers.
