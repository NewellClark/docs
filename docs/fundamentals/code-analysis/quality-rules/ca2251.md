# CA2251: Use `String.Equals` over `String.Compare`

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2251|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The result of a call to <xref:System.String.Compare> is compared to zero.

## Rule description

<xref:System.String.Compare> is designed for producing a total-order comparison that can be used for sorting. If you only care whether the strings are equal, it is both clearer and likely faster to use an equivalent overload of <xref:System.String.Equals>.

## How to fix violations

To fix violations of this rule, replace the expression comparing the result of <xref:System.String.Compare> with a call to <xref:System.String.Equals>.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress warnings from this rule.
